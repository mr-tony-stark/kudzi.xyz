I designed and developed a unique geocoding method to address the lack of precise street addresses affecting half the world's urban population. Leveraging Space-filling curves (SFCs) and a novel hexagonal hierarchical structure inspired by the Gosper curve, this method—building on Uher et al.'s work—ensures unique, proximity-maintaining bijective mapping. It adeptly balances adaptability with user-friendliness, and offline functionality, significantly enhancing service delivery, ecommerce, and urban planning.
